# Where to find code

The bodies are buried in

* '~/repos/jem/calvad/detector_segments'
* '~/repos/jem/osm/sql/views/versioned_routes_work.sql'

If you run the sql found in
'~/repos/jem/calvad/detector_segments/sql/test.sql', then there are
issues right away of course.  I need to write the sqitch code piece by
piece to solve those issues, but working through the code in
`versioned_routes_work`.
