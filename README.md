# PGConf2016 presentation

This is the repo for my pgconf 2016 presentation

The presentation is [here](./presentation/pgconf.html)

The second half of the presentation discusses modifications to an
existing codebase.  The original code base isn't up on github (at the
moment) but it may well get up there eventually.  The ugliest bit of
SQL is included in the presentation in a code block.  The outcome of
the edits described in this presentation are mostly included in the
repo

https://github.com/jmarca/update_detectors_osm

That repo describes that npm install can be used to download the
dependent sqitch-based packages, that all need to be individually
installed.
